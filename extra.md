Chosen bonus feature(s): Integrated chat bot
Explanation (~100 words):
I have implemented a chat bot into the messaging system of the channels and dms.
The way it works is that each time someone wants to chat with the AI, it types in the 
message box '/chat' followed by any statement and the ai will process a response. The functions
use promises hence the express routes have been updated to use async as this feature is built upon the iteration 3
messaging functions.
